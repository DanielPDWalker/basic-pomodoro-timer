# basic-pomodoro-timer
A very simple pomodoro timer made with TKinter.


## Functionality 
- It uses no extra libraries and will run with any version of python after 3.7.
- The timer will play sounds when you have completed a work or break cycle.
- save.py is made use of for keeping track of how many work cycles you have completed. (Updates automatically).
- The settings.py file allows you to change the UI colours and font sizes, as well as the amount of time you wish to work and break for.

To run the timer, just use ```python timer.py``` when in the same folder in a terminal session.
