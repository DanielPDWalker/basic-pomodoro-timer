# basic-pomodoro-timer
A very simple pomodoro timer made with TKinter.

It uses no extra libraries and will run with any version of python after 3.7.

To run the timer, just use '''python timer.py''' when in the same folder in a terminal.

The settings.py file allows you to change the UI colours and font sizes, as well as the amount of time you wish to work and break for.

save.py is just there to keep track of how many full work cycles you have completed, it will automatically update whenever you complete one.
