# basic-pomodoro-timer
A very simple pomodoro timer made with TKinter.


## Functionality 
- It uses no extra libraries and will run with any version of python after 3.7.
- The timer will play sounds when you have completed a work or break cycle.
- The settings.py file allows you to change the UI colours and font sizes, as well as the amount of time you wish to work and break for.

- The "Start Timer" button obviously start the timer. This button is also disabled when the timer starts.
- The "Reset" button just resets the timer back to default. (Re-enabling the "Start Timer" button).
- The "Change Timer" button switches between you work timer and break timer. (The "Start Timer" button switches text as well).
- The "Total Pomodoro Cycles" text and number below are keeping track of completed work cycles by reading and writing to save.py.

To run the timer, just use ```python timer.py``` when in the same folder in a terminal session.
